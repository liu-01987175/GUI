            Cats are generally clean pets and are a great choice for apartment dwelling people. Although not as high maintenance
            as dogs, you still need to play with them, clean litter boxes and shedded fur. They enjoy scratching with their claws
            and may damage furniture. If you want a companion without having to exhaust too much energy, then a cat is a great
            choice.
