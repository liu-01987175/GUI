            Owning a horse can be quite difficult since they need you to have open land where they can roam and graze.
            However, owning one provides a very special experience such as riding and exploring their unique personalities.
            For people who live on a large plot of land or farms and enjoy the outdoors, a horse is a perfect choice.
